How to make capslock behave like esc when tapped and ctrl when pressed?

# ============================================= #
# This didn't work...
https://askubuntu.com/a/856887/1020380
# Install xcape
sudo apt-get install xcape
# Add the two lines in your ~/.profile
/usr/bin/setxkbmap -option 'caps:ctrl_modifier'
/usr/bin/xcape -e 'Caps_Lock=Escape' -t 100
# Notice the part -t 100, if you don't set it, you may notice a delay in Esc if you use vim.
# ============================================= #
# There is a problem with ubuntu 22.04 and xcape

# we can do the same using gnome tweaks
sudo apt install gnome-tweaks

# Stay on Wayland and achieve an effect that comes rather close to what you had with xcape: 
# in Gnome Tweaks, head to the "Keyboard & Mouse" tab. In "Additional layout options", 
# there is an option to make CapsLock an additional Ctrl. 
# You then only loose the possibility to use that key stand alone as Esc.

# Let's try this one too
# https://askubuntu.com/a/1220553/1020380
# Don't use xmodmap. It's a trap!
# Install xcape
# Use gnome-tweaks to turn capslock into control
# Use xcape -d to verify that capslock is key 66
# Set xcape -e '#66=Escape' in Startup Applications or ~/.profile
